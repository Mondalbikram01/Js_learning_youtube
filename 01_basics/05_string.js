const name = "Bikram"

// you can concatinate using + , by this it means you can add them both
// console.log(name + repoCount + "something")//for better code writing don't use this. 
// use interpoletion which is given below. here use backticks `` and ${}
console.log(`My name is ${name} and my number of repository is ${repoCount}`)

// something different 
const gameName =  new String('bikram01')
// this way you will gate more information if you write it in browser console
// console.log(gameName)

// you can get charecter by index number of the string
console.log(gameName[0])
// you can access manything by this way console.log(veriable name.method)
// console.log(gameName.length)
// console.log(gameName.toUpperCase())
console.log(gameName.charAt(3))//you can get charecter by index number of the string. this way also 
console.log(gameName.indexOf('k'))//you can see the charecter position by this way. it must be inside cotetion 



// use terminator is a good habit
